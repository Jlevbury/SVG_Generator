## Description
This weeks challenge was to write a CLI that would allow a user to input specific information to aid in the automated generation of a svg logo for use on their personal projects. This would  involve writing script to make sure of the node.js framework and call on modules to aid in the developer workflow, implementing testing using jest and the built in module for fileSystem. The inquirer module was utilized for prompt generation and collection of the users inputs for design preferences in the SVG.
